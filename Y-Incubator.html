    <h2>Y-Incubator Fund</h2>
    <h3>A Student Driven Search Fund</h3>

    <img src="YIncubator Logo.jpg" height="200" alt="Y-Incubator Logo"><br><br>

    <p>Starting is a struggle: Entrepreneurial students struggle to start from scratch. | Inexperience: Students lack the experience starting, running, and scaling real companies.</p>
    <p>Lack of funds: Students struggle to get the funds to convert ideas into reality. | Fall-Through: Even students that do start companies quit, sell early, or leave the company to die.</p><br>

    Mission Statement: We strive to provide an entrepreneurial search fund where students buy and scale already existing companies.<br><br><br>

    How it works:
    <ol>
        <li> Search
            <ul>
                <li>Entrepreneurs partner with the fund to find a company to acquire.</li>
                <li>
                    Students interested in pursuing careers on the buy-side or sell-side can gain experience as<br>
                    a private equity intern assisting the searchers in sourcing and performing due diligence on <br>
                    various industries and companies.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Acquire
            <ul>
                <li>The fund purchases the company with planned exit.</li>
                <li>Companies start via Sandbox often sell early or are abandoned. The funds serves as an <br>
                    intra-university marketplace for good ideas where students can confidently and successfully <br>
                    their companies. This keeps successful companies and talent within BYU.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Scale
            <ul>
                <li>Entrepreneurs scale company recruiting BYU students to fill various roles.</li>
                <li>Successful BYU alumni will be willing to advise entrepreneurs on specific obstacles to growth</li>
                <li>Students of all majors, such as advertising, engineering, IS, etc., can participate in the various <br>
                roles a company needs. The real-world experience looks great for resumes and interviews. In<br>
                some cases, their roles could turn into full-time roles after graduation.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Exit/Hold
            <ul>
                <li>Company is sold back to entrepreneurs via seller financing or becomes a portfolio company.</li>
                <li>If the company is held as a portfolio company of the fund, this will allow entrepreneurs to <br>
                    fill C-Suite roles, giving them the experience of running tangible, working businesses</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> Reinvest
            <ul>
                <li>All returns are recycled back into the fund to further our purposes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol><br>
    Donor-Advised Fund Model:
    <ol>
        <li> Immediate Tax Benefits
            <ul>
                <li>The fund can rely on donors to BYU to raise capital. All money donated will receive<br>
                    charity status from the government and can be immediately written off.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Donor Benefits
            <ul>
                <li>Although donors cannot expect to receive a return on their donation, other strategic <br>
                    ways of incentivizing donors include possible awarding debt or equity opportunities <br>
                    and a new network of future.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>2% Management Fee
            <ul>
                <li>The fund will charge a 2% management fee to pay for fund management and student <br>
                    internship employment. This helps to retain high quality talent.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
